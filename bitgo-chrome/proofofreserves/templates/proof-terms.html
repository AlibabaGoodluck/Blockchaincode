These Terms govern your access and use of “<b>Verified by BitGo</b>”, which refers to the reporting interface on the www.bitgo.com website (“<b>Site</b>”) that reports the bitcoin held by the Third Party company (“<b>Third Party</b>”) in BitGo hosted wallets, including any written or electronic materials, data, text, audio video, images or other content (“<b>Content</b>”), software used to enable the reporting interface, or related services. These Terms refer to the individual or entity using Verified by BitGo (including any component of Verified by BitGo) as “<b>you</b>” and “<b>your</b>”.

        By using Verified by BitGo in any way, you are accepting and agreeing to these Terms, and the policies and guidelines referenced in these Terms. These Terms require the use of arbitration to resolve disputes on an individual basis, rather than jury trials or on resolution by class action, as further described in <b>Section 19.5</b>.
      </div>
      <div class="whitePaper-text">
        BitGo may amend these Terms at any time by either: (a) posting the revised Terms on the Site; or (b) presenting a message notifying you of the amended Terms when you use Verified by BitGo, or (c) by email sent to the address you provided to BitGo if you are a BitGo account holder. It is your responsibility to keep the email address in our records (if any) up-to-date, to check your email (as well as your junk folder), and to periodically revisit these Terms. Amended Terms take effect when BitGo provides you with such notice, when you accept the amended Terms, or ten (10) days after posted to the Site – whichever occurs first.

              <ol>
                <li>
                  YOU AND BITGO AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE Verified by BitGo OR THESE TERMS (INCLUDING THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OR APPLICABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE) SHALL BE DETERMINED BY BINDING ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings will be English. You agree that you and BitGo are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive any termination of other terms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The arbitrator shall not have the power to award damages that are limited or waived by these Terms (such as punitive damages, treble damages, or any other damages which are not compensatory), to the extent such limitation or waiver is permitted under applicable law, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages. Further, the arbitrator shall have no power to issue any award that is contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable statute, case law or constitutional law, to modify, change or excuse performance of any material term of this Agreement, or to award equitable relief. The arbitration proceedings and decision of the arbitrator shall be kept confidential (and may not be disclosed) by the parties or the arbitrator, except to the extent necessary to compel any award made by the arbitrator.
                </li>
                The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or if you reside outside the U.S.A., pursuant to JAMS International Arbitration Rules (in each case, the “Rules”).
                <li>
                  The arbitration hearings will take place in Palo Alto, California, unless the selection of that location would render these arbitration provisions unconscionable or otherwise unenforceable.  If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such location would render these arbitration provisions unconscionable or otherwise unenforceable, then either: (a) at your option, you elect to make the arbitration convenient by being conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, with the parties participating through a telephonic hearing; or (b) the location for arbitration shall be determined by the arbitrator pursuant to the Rules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  YOU AND BITGO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and BitGo agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

            IF ARBITRATION CANNOT BE COMPELLED UNDER THE TERMS SET FORTH IN SECTION 19, OR I IF THE PROVISIONS IN SECTION 19.5 ARE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN: (A) SECTION 19 WILL BE DEEMED VOID AND WITHOUT AFFECT; AND (B) YOU AND BITGO HEREBY AGREE AND IRREVOCABLY CONSENT TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS LOCATED IN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A. FOR ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF IN CONNECTION WITH  THE Verified by BitGo OR THESE TERMS (INCLUDING THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Severability</b>.  Each provision of these Terms (a “Provision”) shall be deemed severable.  If (i) any Provision or (ii) the application of any Provision to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of any jurisdiction, then: (a) the Provision shall be ineffective only in that jurisdiction; (b) the Provision shall be ineffective only to the extent that it has been expressly held to be invalid or unenforceable in that jurisdiction; and (c) the ineffectiveness of the Provision shall not invalidate any other provision of these Terms or the application of the Provision itself to persons or circumstances other than those with respect to which it was held invalid or unenforceable in the jurisdiction in question.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Interpretation</b>.  The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms will not be construed in favor of or against any party by reason of the extent to which any party participated in the drafting of these Terms. The failure of either party to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any of the provisions of these Terms or to exercise any rights or remedies under these Terms will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such party's right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance; rather, the same will remain in full force and effect. The word “or” will be interpreted to have the same meaning as “and/or”.  The word "any" will be interpreted to have the same meaning as "any and all".  The terms ‘include’ and ‘including’ will be deemed to be immediately followed by the phrase “without limitation.” We each agree to contract in the English language.  In the event of a conflict between the FAQ and these Terms, these Terms shall prevail. These Terms govern our Verified by BitGos but do not govern use of our hosted wallets or API services.  This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the parties.
