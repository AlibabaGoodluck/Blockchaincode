          <div class="whitePaper-text">
            BitGo will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the BitGo Platform API available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage (defined below) of at least the percentage specified in our Service Tiers, during each monthly billing cycle (the “<b><i>Service Commitment</i></b>”). In the event the BitGo Platform API does not meet the Service Commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below.

                “<b><i>Monthly Uptime Percentage</i></b>” is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes during the monthly billing cycle in which the BitGo Platform API, was “<b><i>Unavailable</i></b>” meaning that when your server make API request calls within your account’s per-second, per-minute and per-hour request limits, our servers fail to respond to such requests.  Monthly Uptime Percentage measurements exclude any Exclusion as defined below.

          <div class="whitePaper-text">
            To receive a Service Credit, you must submit a claim by opening a case in the <a href="https://bitgo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank">BitGo Support Center</a>. To be eligible, the credit request must be received by us within ten (10) days of the end of the billing cycle in which the incident occurred and must include:
          </div>
          <div class="whitePaper-text">
            <ul>
              <li>
                the words “SLA Credit Request” in the subject line;
              </li>
              <li>
                the dates and times of each Unavailability incident that you are claiming;
              </li>
              <li>
                the affected account; and
              </li>
              <li>
                your request logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in these logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks).

            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="whitePaper-text">
            If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such request is confirmed by us and is less than the Service Commitment, then we will issue the Service Credit to you within one billing cycle following the month in which your request is confirmed by us. Your failure to provide the request and other information as required above will disqualify you from receiving a Service Credit.
          </div>
          <div class="whitePaper-text">
            We will apply any Service Credits only against future payments for BitGo Platform API otherwise due from you. At our discretion, we may issue the Service Credit to the credit card you used to pay for the billing cycle in which the Unavailability occurred. Service Credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment from BitGo. A Service Credit will be applicable and issued only if the credit amount for the applicable monthly billing cycle is greater than one dollar ($1 USD). Service Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account.  Your sole and exclusive remedy for any unavailability, non-performance, or other failure by us to provide the BitGo Platform API or related Services is the receipt of a Service Credit (if eligible) in accordance with the terms of this SLA, and will you will have no remedy for downtime or unavailability due to any Exclusion.
