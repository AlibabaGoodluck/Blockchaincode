                  As the regulatory front evolves, the business models are evolving as well. Bitfinex, a Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange that ranks as one of the largest exchanges, unveiled a feature on Wednesday aimed at increasing the transparency into its holdings.  The firm is now offering individual multi-sig wallets through a partnership with BitGo that will provide segregated customer accounts, a “proof of reserves” concept that aims to provide complete visibility into customer holdings.

                  In the past, most exchanges had to sacrifice either speed or security if they wanted to be able to offer accounts where the users could double-check the funds on the exchange in real time via the blockchain. Thanks to BitGo, Bitfinex is now the first exchange to offer this with no compromises to performance or security.

                  Earlier today, Palo Alto­ based Bitcoin security service provider BitGo announced the general availability of the BitGo Platform API, which will allow developers to fully leverage, for the first time ever, the enterprise ­grade security features of BitGo’s multi­sig HD wallet in their own applications. The launch of this particular service stands to be a turning point in the Bitcoin industry. That’s because all companies, whether general merchants or Bitcoin service providers, are now capable of integrating the Bitcoin protocol into their core product without being forced to give up control of their bitcoins to a third party, or without facing the multiple and complex Bitcoin security challenges that have brought otherwise strong companies to their knees.

                  O’Brien notably illustrated how he expects security to advance in the year ahead.

                  “BitGo is recognized as the first wallet to offer multisig services, in which a Bitcoin address possesses not one, but three individual sets of private keys. Two sets of keys go to the user—one is stored on her computer, and the other is stored somewhere offline (on paper in a safe, for example). The service provider then holds the third key. A signature by two of the three keys is required to execute a transaction (called a “two of three”), and this simple process provides several benefits.“

                  “We believe the main reason there are still so many bitcoins in cold storage is simple inertia. It is scary to move millions of dollars from a storage system that has worked fine, so far, to a new storage system, even if you are confident the new system is better. But enough time has passed and enough diligence has been performed to conclude that multi-sig is fundamentally a better solution than single-key cold storage. BitGo is calling on all of the major players in the industry to make multi-sig a top priority. Whether you build your own multi-sig, or use a security platform service provider, we need to commit to multi-sig in order to make a safer bitcoin ecosystem and ensure the future growth we all hope to see.”
