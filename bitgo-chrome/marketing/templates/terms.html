Please read these terms of service ("<b>Terms</b>") carefully as they form a contract between you and BitGo, Inc. (“<b>BitGo</b>”).  These Terms govern your access and use of the BitGo “<b>Service</b>”, which refers individually and collectively to all written or electronic materials, data, text, audio video, images or other content ("<b>Content</b>") and software made available through the www.bitgo.com website ("<b>Site</b>").  These Terms refer to the individual or entity using the Service (including any component of the Service) as “<b>you</b>”.
</p>
By using the Service, visiting the Site, or registering for an account with us, you are accepting and agreeing to these Terms, and the policies and guidelines referenced in these Terms.  These Terms require the use of arbitration to resolve disputes on an individual basis, rather than jury trials or on resolution a collective basis.

Bitcoin is complicated, and these terms are not simple.  We hope this section will make reading the legalese a little easier.

BitGo may amend these Terms at any time by posting the revised Terms on the Site.  If you have a BitGo account, BitGo will send you a message notifying you of the amended Terms when you use the Service, or by email sent to the address in your BitGo account.  It is your responsibility to keep the email address for your account up-to-date, to check your email (as well as your junk folder), and to periodically revisit these Terms. Amended Terms take effect when posted to the Site, when BitGo gives such notice, or when you, or when you otherwise accept the amended Terms – whichever occurs first.

We will update these terms from time to time, and we'll contact you every way we know how.  But it is your responsibility to stay up to date.

<h4>1. About Bitcoin And The BitGo Service</h4>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td class="terms-legalese">
    <h5>1.1 Bitcoin Network Information.</h5>
The Service does not send or receive money.  As a bitcoin wallet, it transmits to and from the bitcoin network information about bitcoin blocks that are associated with a public cryptographic key commonly referred to as a bitcoin address – we refer to it as a “bitcoin account”.  By using the Service, you can inform the bitcoin network that you are transferring bitcoin previously associated with your bitcoin account to another bitcoin account.  Once the network recognizes the information you send from the Service and validates it, the bitcoin network distributes the information to other individuals and companies in the network. The Service cannot be used by you to cancel or reverse bitcoin-to-bitcoin transactions, as long as they are accepted and confirmed on the bitcoin network.
  </td>
  <td class="terms-english">
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
BitGo's site may look like a bank - but it isn't a bank.  We couldn't spend your money if we wanted to,
because we don't have access to it. But you can spend your money without talking to BitGo. And if BitGo disappears, you still have your money. These are not true with a bank.</p>

BitGo is just a paper pusher.  We fill out a check, but you sign it.</p>

  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td class="terms-legalese">
   <h5>1.2 Your Accounts.</h5>
Your individual bitcoin accounts are your property and your responsibility. The Service utilizes these bitcoin accounts only to provide the functionality of a bitcoin wallet. BitGo cannot make transactions using your bitcoin accounts except in conjunction with a request or command by your use of the Service.
  </td>
  <td class="terms-english">
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
Your bitcoin accounts and backups are your responsibility.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="terms-legalese">
   <h5>1.3 Passwords and Security.</h5>
You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all login IDs, passwords, private bitcoin keys, personal identification numbers (PINs), and any other codes that you use to access the Service.  You are solely responsible for properly backing up and storing all of your private keys and PINs. You must keep your account ID, passwords any other account credentials confidential and not authorize any third party to access or use the Service on your behalf, unless we provide an approved mechanism for such use.   You must contact customer support immediately by email at <a href="mailto:support@bitgo.com">support@bitgo.com</a> if you suspect misuse of your account or any security breach.  You will be responsible, and BitGo will have no liability, for all activity that takes place with your BitGo Service account accessed using your account credentials whether or not authorized by you. In the event of any such unauthorized use, you will take all steps necessary to terminate such unauthorized use, and cooperate with BitGo as BitGo may reasonably request.
  </td>
  <td class="terms-english">
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
Your passwords are your responsibility.  Pick really good ones, and use security best practices.  If you lose them, or if your machine picks up a virus, there is nothing we can do to help.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="terms-legalese">
   <h5>1.4 Two Key Transactions.</h5>
 The Service requires three private cryptographic keys to be associated with each bitcoin account, and requires two of these private keys to initiate a bitcoin “transfer”.  BitGo controls only one of these private keys.  Depending on your volume or value of bitcoin transfer, BitGo may require you to use both private keys under your control to initiate the transfer.
  </td>
  <td class="terms-english">
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
BitGo accounts use multiple signatures to keep things a little safer.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="terms-legalese">
   <h5>1.5 Identity Authentication.</h5>
You must be at least 18 years old, or such higher age required by applicable law, to register for a BitGo Service account. You will provide BitGo and its affiliates with accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration process, and keep such information updated.  You authorize BitGo to make such inquiries that it considers necessary to validate your identity. BitGo may do so using third party service providers.

BitGo doesn't need a lot of information about you, but we do expect you to be truthful.  BitGo is
not intended for minors.

  <td class="terms-legalese">
   <h5>1.6 Third Party Applications.</h5>
If you grant express permission for a third party to connect to your BitGo Service account, either through the third party's product or through the Service, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under these Terms. Further, you acknowledge and agree that you will not hold BitGo responsible for, and will indemnify BitGo from, any liability arising from the actions or omissions of this third party in connection with the permissions you grant. You may change or remove these permissions from the account settings page.
  </td>
  <td class="terms-english">
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
If you trust someone else with your passwords or keys, it makes it impossible for BitGo to keep you safe.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="terms-legalese">
   <h5>1.7 Taxes.</h5>
It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to any transactions you make or receive, and it is your responsibility to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. BitGo is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transactions, or for collecting, reporting or remitting any taxes arising from any transactions.
  </td>
  <td class="terms-english">
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
BitGo doesn't do anything to help with your taxes.  Be sure to understand your own tax obligations.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="terms-legalese">
   <h5>1.8 Bitcoin Risks.</h5>
 BitGo has no control over, and makes no representations regarding the value of bitcoins, or the security of the bitcoin network.  The value of bitcoin can change rapidly, increase or decrease unexpectedly, and potentially even fall to zero. You acknowledge that bitcoin ownership and participation in the bitcoin network involves risk.  A bitcoin transaction may be unconfirmed for a period of time (usually less than one hour, but up to one day or longer) and may be never complete if it remains in a pending state.

<h5>5.5. Arbitration.</h5>
 YOU AND BITGO AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE WALLET OR THESE TERMS SHALL BE DETERMINED BY BINDING ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION.  You agree that you and BitGo are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and to participate in a class action.  This arbitration provision shall survive any termination of other terms or the termination of your BitGo Service account.
</p>
   5.5.1. Notice.  The party seeking arbitration must notify the other as follows.  If you seek arbitration, you must send to BitGo, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim ("Notice") to the address at the end of these terms ("Notice Address"). If BitGo seeks arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice to the address in your registration information, or if you have not provided your address, then to the email address we have for your account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by BitGo, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The arbitrator shall not have the power to award damages that are limited or waived by these Terms (such as punitive damages, treble damages, or any other damages which are not compensatory), to the extent such limitation or waiver is permitted under applicable law.  The arbitration proceedings and decision of the arbitrator shall be kept confidential (and may not be disclosed) by the parties or the arbitrator, except to the extent necessary to compel any award made by the arbitrator.
</p>
   5.5.2. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.  The arbitrator shall be bound by these Terms.  The arbitration hearings will take place in San Francisco, California.  However, if you reside outside of the United States of America, you will afford BitGo the opportunity to elect to make the arbitration convenient by either: (a) being conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, with the parties participating through a telephonic hearing; or (b) arbitrating in your country of residence at a location reasonably convenient to you and BitGo.
</p>
   5.5.3. YOU AND BITGO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and BitGo agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
</p>
   5.5.4. CHOICE OF FORUM IN LIEU OF ARBITRATION.  IF THE PROVISIONS IN SECTION 5.5.3 ARE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN SECTION 5.5 WILL BE DEEMED VOID AND WITHOUT AFFECT.  FURTHER, IF ARBITRATION CANNOT BE COMPELLED UNDER THE TERMS SET FORTH IN SECTION 5.5, OR IF SECTION 5.5.3 IS NOT ENFORCEABLE, THEN YOU AND BITGO AGREE AND IRREVOCABLY CONSENT TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A.

<h5>6.5 Savings Clause.</h5>
 If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court or arbitrator should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.  If the court or arbitrator cannot do so, then the parties agree that the court or arbitrator should strike the invalid or unenforceable provisions, and that the remaining provisions be given their full force and effect.

<h5>6.6 Company Use.</h5>
 If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising to BitGo that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (in which event, "you" and "your" will refer to that organization). Nevertheless, each individual that uses the Service or accepts these Terms on behalf of an organization agrees that the permissions given to BitGo under these Terms, and the restrictions and limitations to the rights of persons and entities using the Service, apply to each such individual. You may use the Service only in compliance with these Terms and only if you have the power to form a contract with BitGo and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so.

<h5>6.7 Interpretation.</h5>
 The section titles in these Terms and summary descriptions (labeled "English") are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  These Terms will not be construed in favor of or against any party by reason of the extent to which any party participated in the drafting of these Terms. The failure of either party to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any of the provisions of these Terms or to exercise any rights or remedies under these Terms will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such party's right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance; rather, the same will remain in full force and effect. The word “or” as used in these Terms has the same meaning as “and/or”.  The terms ‘include’ and ‘including’ will be deemed to be immediately followed by the phrase “without limitation.”
