    BitGo keeps your Bitcoin secure using passwords only known to you.
    These passwords are never transmitted to BitGo, and are only used
    inside of your browser.
    As such, when you lose your password, the recovery process will
    guide you through safely re-encrypting all of your wallet passwords
    within your browser.
